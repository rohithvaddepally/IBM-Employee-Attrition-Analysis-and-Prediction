# 📉 IBM Employee Attrition Analysis & Prediction

This project applies multiple supervised machine learning models to analyze and predict employee attrition using the IBM HR Analytics dataset. The goal is to identify key factors influencing employee turnover and evaluate which ML models provide the most accurate predictions.

# 🔍 Project Overview

Dataset: 1470 rows, 35 features, no missing values.

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, correlation reduction, encoding, and scaling.

Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE to balance attrition classes.

Implemented 7 ML algorithms including Logistic Regression, XGBoost, SVM, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and Decision Tree.

Compared models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.

# ⭐ Key Results

XGBoost achieved the highest accuracy (84.12%) 

AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting achieved the best ROC-AUC scores (0.745)
